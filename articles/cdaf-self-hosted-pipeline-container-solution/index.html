<h1 id="principles">Principles</h1>
<p>Self-hosted Pipeline Container Solution extends the following key principles of CDAF:</p>
<h2 id="loose-coupling">loose coupling</h2>
<p>Ensure the solution is portable between toolsets, with the ability for automation developers to test their changes locally. This reduces the temptation to in-line with the pipeline tool itself.</p>
<h2 id="idempotency">Idempotency</h2>
<p>A deployment should be re-runnable, performing no changes when none are required.</p>
<h2 id="source-of-truth">Source of Truth</h2>
<p>Application code and properties are driven from source control, with the only elements never to be in source control are secrets. It is encouraged to use canonical images and code your build/runtime dependencies so you are the master of your own destiny.</p>
<h2 id="12-factors">12 Factors</h2>
<p>Build once, deploy many. Deploy all environments (excluding Feature Branches) from the same artefact, applying environment variations at deploy time, not build time. A release deploys artefacts, not code, and as such should have no knowledge of source control. This principle should be applied to compiled and interpretive languages alike.</p>
